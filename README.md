## Hungaroton Artist List Component
Implement a list view with pagination and filters. The list should include the
portrait, name, and albumCount in each item. You can find the Postman
documentation among the attachments, which contains all the necessary
information about the endpoint required for the task.
Requirements:
-Tech stack: Typescript, React, Next.js
-Use a known design system like MUI or ANTD
-Use URLSearchParams to store the filter params
-The application should be responsive
-Display 50 items per page
Nice to have:
-Host the application on AWS Amplify
-Write some end-to-end tests
